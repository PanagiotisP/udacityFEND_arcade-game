### Game Explanation

This is the Arcade Game Master Project for Udacity's Front End Development Nanodegree. 
The game resembles the frog who tries to cross the road game: control a player's movement until you reach the water blocks, while avoiding the enemies.
If you cross the road the game resets. If you get hit by the enemies the player returns to starting position without reset of the enemies.

### Run the game
The game runs as soon as you open **index.html** in a browser. The **js**, **css** and **images** folders should be at the *same* folder as **index.html**.

### Play the game
The game's controls are very simple. You use the four arrow keys to move the player. Movements which sends the player out of bounds are ignored.

At any point of the game you can reset it by clicking the reset arrow.
